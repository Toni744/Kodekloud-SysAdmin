The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Solution:  
1. At first login to all App server  & Switch to  root user
ssh tony@stapp01
2. Install cronie package on server 
yum install cronie -y
3.  Start cron service & check the  status 
systemctl start crond.service
4.  Create a cronjob  as per the task for root user
crontab -e
5.  Check cron job for user root
crontab -l
6.  Validate  cron_text file is created successfully, before that done finish the task
ll /tmp/
