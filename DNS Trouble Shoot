DNS Troubleshooting

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server. As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Solution:-
ssh on App Server According to task

ssh tony@stapp01  #App Server 1  ******
### OR
ssh steve@stapp02 #App Server 2  ******
### OR
ssh banner@stapp03 #App Server 3 ******
#######################
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

Insert these lines below "search stratos.xfusioncorp.com"

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
