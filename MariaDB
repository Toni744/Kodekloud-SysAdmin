There is a critical issue going on with the ***** application in Stratos DC.

The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database.

After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.



Look into the issue and fix the same.

Solution


ssh peter@stdb01

sudo systemctl status mariadb
#This shows loading failed for db service

chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mariadb
#Change owner for mariadb under the runtime variable data directory

sudo systemctl start mariadb
#start mariadb service

sudo systemctl status mariadb
#check status to ensure service has started
